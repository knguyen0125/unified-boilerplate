# NestJS + React Full Stack Boilerplate

## Prerequisite

- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- mkcert

## Local Development

```bash
# Generate Local SSL certificate and install with system trust store. Requires mkcert. Only need to run once
./mkcert.sh

# Start the local development
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Notes for WSL2

In WSL2, we need to install the root CA certificate generated by mkcert to the system's trust store. Make sure that mkcert.sh ran successfully

Step 1: In the start menu, find mmc.exe
Step 2: In File => Add/Remove Snap-ins, choose Certificates
Step 3: In Certificates - Current User => Trusted Root Certification Authorities => Certificates, right click on Certificates, then All tasks => Import...
Step 3: Locate the certificate file. This is usually in Linux => Ubuntu => home/$username/.local/share/mkcert/rootCA.pem (you might need to change extension to * to show the file)

## Database migrations

Database migrations are handled automatically as part of the application start up.
